# Food_Delivery_App_Data_Analysis

This project is real-world project, I analyzed the real-world database using SQL, I learnt how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using python for better upcoming performance, and how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database.

This is the real world data analysis project conducted by HiCounselor.
It Contains 2 modules: In module 1, we have to do cleaning process which is done in some steps:

Step 1 : Removing unwanted columns. For removing unwanted columns, first we have to load the Zomato dataset.
Then remove unwanted columns.
Step 2 : Renaming the columns for easy analysis.
Step 3 : Dealing with Null values in every column.
Step 4 : Dropping the duplicate values.
Step 5 : Removing the irrelevant texts from each column.
Step 6 : Checking for unique values and handling the irrelevant ones.
Step 7 : Removing the special characters from the dataset.

In module 2, we have to do our analysis using SQL queries.
